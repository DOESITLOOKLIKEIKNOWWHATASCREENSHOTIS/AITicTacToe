# TicTacToe
There are 3 gamemodes. 

Human vs Human: You and another human player play TicTacToe

Human vs AI: Select 1 of the AIs to play against in TicTacToe

AI vs AI: Both of the currect AIs play against each other. This is a great way for both sides to learn quickly on how to play TicTacToe

Settings, this allows you to change which AI model are playing in the game.
